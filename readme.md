<h1>Record // Record</h1>
Project by Kristofer DeSpain
<h3>Description</h3>
<hr>
<p>
Record Record is intended as a web app for the tracking and maintaining of ones own record/album collection. Additionally, this is intended to be used to create a wish list of albums that you want to procure of have yet to do so. 

The app is not finished in its current state, and would take a bit more work to complete. Currently a user can create an account and login, as well as search any artist and return a list of that artists top albums. The functionality of adding these albums to the various lists is currently in development.
